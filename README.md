# Deep Learning in Particle Physics
###### Created by Patrick T. Komiske and Eric M. Metodiev
###### Under modification by Katie Fraser, Lauren Niu, Baojia Tong for jet charge

This is a collection of code that grew out of [1612.01551](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.01551) and related projects. It contains Python code for processing events, computing values of observables, creating jet images from an event record, and training neural networks. It also contains Pythia event generation code.

### Helpful Resources
##### Deep Learning

There are many introductions and free online tutorials on machine learning and deep learning. There is not a very high barrier to understanding the various algorithms and architectures. We will highlight some useful resources that are particularly helpful.

* Michael Nielsen's [online textbook](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html) gives a no-nonsense introduction starting from the basic definition of a neuron and neural network through convolutional net architectures much like the one used in the deep learning with jet images study.

* I. Goodfellow, Y. Bengion, and A. Courville's [deep learning textbook](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/) has its chapters available online through their website. This book provides a more in-depth treatment of many aspects of deep learning and the mathematical preprequisites.

##### High Energy Physics

##### Keras

[Keras](keras.io) is a deep learning library for Python, which wraps other powerful neural network libraries (Theano and Tensorflow) to provide a way to quickly define neural networks based on the high-level architecture.

As you'll see, Keras lets you quickly implement and train the architecture you want. You can essentially build a network by adding layers in Keras with single lines such as `model.add(Dense(50))` to add a 50-neuron dense layer.

##### Pythia

Pythia was the high priestess in the Temple of Apollo at Dephi, more commonly known as the Oracle of Delphi. 

[Pythia](http://home.thep.lu.se/~torbjorn/Pythia.html) is also a C++ event generator that outputs realistic LHC event records for the process you want. It seems like an apt name for a black box program that magically outputs events. When you're getting started, you'll probably use event files others generate and give to you (a second-order black-box), but it's an important skill to have and not that hard to get started.


### Getting Started
#### Setting up Keras

1. Install [Python 3.5](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-353/).

2. Python3.5 should come with pip3.5. You can also download it online. At the terminal, execute the following:
```
pip3.5 install -U keras
pip3.5 install -U h5py
pip3.5 install -U matplotlib
pip3.5 install -U jupyter
```

3. Start an interactive python session in the terminal by executing `python3.5`. Try importing keras, `import keras`. This should fail with a message like:
```
Error, no module named tensorflow installed.
```
Thatâ€™s expected. We have to tell Keras to use Theano as its deep learning backend instead. At the terminal, execute:
```
cd ~/.keras/
nano keras.json
```
This should open a basic text editor with the Keras settings. Change the "backend" field to "theano" and change "image_data_format" to "channels_first". Then use `ctrl + X` to quit and save changes.

4. Start another interactive python session with `python3.5` and again try importing keras with `import keras`. If everything is installed properly, it should import without errors this time. You now have Keras successfully installed!

There are many [Keras examples](https://github.com/fchollet/keras/tree/master/examples) that run straight out of the box. Just download the file and run it with Python. Examples include dense neural nets, convolutional neural nets, recurrent neural nets, and so on. The examples are great starting points to get some experience with Keras. If you're trying to start building a new network, these examples can be a good place to start.

#### Setting up Pythia

Coming soon! (Current code in src/ is out of date)

#### Heppy

The High-Energy Physics for Python package contians some basic functionality that has been built up for 1612.01551 and related projects. It is called in the examples. More details coming soon!

### Example

Here are some examples that can be run from the `python/` directory using Python 3.5. There are two examples:
```bash
python3 jet_image_conv_example.py
```
and
```bash
python3 image_generation_example.py
```

The first example trains a convolutional neural net on jet images, which would be sped up significantly if we were using a GPU to do the heavy lifting of training the network. Nonetheless, if it starts training then it means your Keras installation is working.

The `src/` directory contains event generation code. Take a look at the beginning of `Events.cc` for options. Requires Pythia8 and FastJet to be installed and pythis8-config and fastjet-config to be available in the `PATH` (for the makefile to work as is). A standard invocation after compiling would look like
```bash
 ./events -out gluon-event-seed1.txt -pthatmin 160 -ptjetmin 200 -Zg -seed 1
```
